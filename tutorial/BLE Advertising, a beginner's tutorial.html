<h1 class="tutorial-heading">BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial</h1>

<p class="tutorial-preamble"><b><i>The purpose of this tutorial is to get you started with the basics of the nRF5x and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The tutorial is fairly superficial and is meant to be a hands-on introduction to BLE advertising and broadcasting of a limited payload. Hopefully after going through these steps you will be able to set up a BLE link, advertise your intentions and send your first bytes of data over the air.</i></b></p>

<p></p><h3>Equipment and software</h3>
To complete this tutorial you will need the following:<p></p>
<ul><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF51-DK">nRF51 DK or nRF52 DK Development Kit</a>
</li><li><a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/nRF51-Dongle">nRF51 Dongle</a>
</li><li>Keil V5.17.
</li><li><a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51822#Downloads">Master Control Panel (MCP) V3.10.0</a>. (You can also use the Master Control Panel found in the nRF Toolbox app for Android or the LightBlue app for iPhone)
</li><li><a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-Smart-Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF51822#Downloads">nRFgo Studio V1.21.0.2</a>
</li><li><a href="http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF51_SDK/">SDK V11.0.0-2.alpha</a> <strong>NOTE! This tutorial is written for SDK V11.0.0-2.alpha. Example files for SDK V8.x.0 and SDK V9.0.0 can also be found on github, but the APIs are different.</strong>
</li><li>For nRF51 DK use <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF51822/S130-SD-v2/51469">SoftDevice S130 V2.0.0-7.alpha</a> for nRF52 DK use <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF52832/S132-SD-v2/51479">S132 V2.0.0-7.alpha</a>. 
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf51-ble-tutorial-advertising">Example files found on github</a>.
</li></ul></ul><p><strong>NOTE!</strong> Using the exact SDK and Softdevice versions is <strong>VERY</strong> important. As of today (2016.02.09) these are alpha releases, and the tutorial will be updated when the final releases are available.</p>
<p>Other kits, dongles and software versions might work as well, but this is what I have used. This tutorial will not cover how to install and setup the software. Please search the forum if you run into trouble before posting questions here. </p>
<p></p><h3>Necessary prior knowledge </h3>
It is expected that you have basic knowledge of how to use Keil, MCP and nRFgo Studio and how to download your application to your kit. Please browse the <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/">Tutorial section</a> and the <a href="http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/">Infocenter</a> to find guides on how to use your equipment and compile your first BLE application. <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/blogs/782/bluetooth-smart-and-the-nordics-softdevices-part-1/">Here</a> is an excellent blogpost that I highly recommend you read. It provides a more in depth explanation on how advertising works and is a natural supplement to this tutorial. <p></p>
<p><strong>If you run into troubles please browse devzone, look for documentation on our <a href="http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp">Infocenter</a>, and read the user guides for your kits. I urge you to post any questions you might have on the forum and not below the tutorial. This makes it is easier for other users and Nordic employees to see and search for your question and you will actually most likely get a faster response(!).</strong></p>
<p></p><h1>The “Hello world” example</h1>
First thing first: download the example code from github. It is based on the template example found in the SDK V11.0.0-2.alpha, but stripped of all code that is not necessary for our purpose. There is still quite a lot of code left though, which is used to initiate and utilize processes running in the background. The code is not essential for this tutorial and can be left as is. If you are curious of what it is anyway then here are some links to documentation on some of the modules that are used in the code:<p></p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v11.0.0/group__device__manager.html">Device Manager</a>. This is a module that handles active and bonded connections. Since this tutorial is about advertising and not connections it is not really relevant. Still I chose to leave it in the code as it is extensively used in more advanced examples, so I figured you might just as well get used to it being there and it doesn't do any harm. </li>
<li><a href="http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.sdk51.v10.0.0/group__bsp.html?resultof=%22%62%75%74%74%6f%6e%22%20%22%73%75%70%70%6f%72%74%22%20">The Button Support Package (bsp)</a>. This module is used to handle the LEDs and the buttons. In this example you will notice that an LED is blinking when your board is advertising. After 180 seconds the board will stop advertising and go to sleep. Then you can push Button 1 and the board will wake up and start advertising again. All this is handled by the bsp module. </li>
<li>Various _evt() and _dispatch() functions. These are functions that handle BLE and system events that originates in the Softdevice. They also allow your application to take various actions based on what is going on in the Softdevice. We will not dwell on these functions in this tutorial. </li>
</ol>
<p>To compile the example download the files and copy the folder "nrf51-ble-tutorial-advertising" to "your_SDK_v11.0.0-2.alpha_folder\examples\ble_peripheral". Your main.c file should then be found in the folder "your_SDK_v11.0.0-2.alpha_folder\examples\ble_peripheral\nrf51-ble-tutorial-advertising". The example is intended for the zipped version of the SDK. It will <strong>not work</strong> with the Pack installer. If you need help with this please have a look at this thread on devzone: <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/35068/compiling-github-projects/">Compiling github projects</a>. Open the project file "ble_app_tutorial_advertising.uvprojx" and hit “Build”.  It should compile without any errors or warnings. </p>
<p></p><h1>Advertising</h1>
Now, let us have some fun right away. Make sure you have programmed the correct SoftDevice to your nRF5x DK kit and compiled the example successfully. Then hit the download button in Keil and load the example onto your kit as well. Open MCP and start discovery using your nRF51 Dongle as master emulator. To learn how to use MCP and a master emulator read this tutorial: <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/tutorials/4/testing-and-using-a-simple-ble-application/">Testing and using a simple BLE application</a>. A device named “HelloWorld” should show up in the list of discovered devices as shown in the picture below. 
<img src="./BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial_files/97d2f383c10d56164ae429d74a602f24" alt="Discovered device(s)"><p></p>
<p>What you see in the picture is:</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>The device name as defined in our main.c file. Try to search for <code>#define DEVICE_NAME</code> in your code and change the string to something of your own choice (just don’t make it too long). Now compile and download your application again and see how your device name has changed.
</li><li>The Bluetooth Device Address. Similar to a Media Access Control address (MAC address), but not necessarily universally unique.
</li><li>The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). This is a value of how good your signal strength is. Move your kit around or lay your hand over the PCB antenna on your kit and see how the RSSI changes. 
</li></ul></ul><p></p><h2>The Advertising packet</h2>
Now expand the "HelloWorld" device tree by clicking on the little cross to the left. You should see something similar to the next image.
<img src="./BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial_files/0aa53854483df96a923d2513f4e1a66b" alt="Your first advertising packet"><p></p>
<p>What you see here is:</p>
<p></p><h3>RSSI</h3>
The Received Signal Strength Indicator as mentioned above.<p></p>
<p></p><h3>Address</h3>
The Bluetooth Device Address as mentioned above.<p></p>
<p></p><h3>Address Type</h3>
Address type as defined in the Bluetooth Core specification. See <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/6496/gap-address-types/">this post</a> on devzone for more on address types. The default address type in our example is “Random static address”. Try to go into <code>gap_params_init()</code> in main.c and add these four lines at the end of the function:<p></p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="typ">ble_gap_addr_t</span><span class="pln"> gap_address</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
gap_address</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">addr_type </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> BLE_GAP_ADDR_TYPE_RANDOM_PRIVATE_RESOLVABLE</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
err_code </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> sd_ble_gap_address_set</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">BLE_GAP_ADDR_CYCLE_MODE_AUTO</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">&amp;</span><span class="pln">gap_address</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln">
APP_ERROR_CHECK</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">err_code</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="com">// Check for errors</span></code></pre>
<p>This will set the address type to “Private Resolvable address”.The Address type will still show up as “Random”, but try to reset your board a few times. You should see that after each reset your device shows up with a different address in the device list. This functionality might be handy in certain situations demanding higher security. Remove the lines again to change the address type back to “Random static address”. </p>
<p></p><h3>Advertising Type</h3>
To keep it simple there are two advertising types; connectable and non-connectable. Non-connectable might be useful if you just need one-way communication and only need to broadcast a couple of bytes. One use case for this might for example be <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/News/ULP-Wireless-Update/The-next-level-of-location-awareness/%28language%29/eng-GB">location awareness</a>. If you want to send more data to a specific device, on the other hand, you need a connectable device. Examples here might be a heart rate sensor connected to an app on your phone or a Bluetooth headset. <p></p>
<p></p><h3>Bonded</h3>
This shows whether the device is bonded to another device or not. The purpose of bonding is described in the <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/adopted-specifications">Bluetooth Core Specification 4.2</a> as: <p></p>
<ul>"The purpose of bonding is to create a relation between two Bluetooth devices based on a common link key (a bond). The link key is created and exchanged (pairing) during the bonding procedure and is expected to be stored by both Bluetooth devices, to be used for future authentication[...]"</ul><p></p><h1>Advertising Data</h1>
Now to the fun part! Go to the <code>advertising_init()</code> function. The advertising data fields contained in the <code>advdata</code> variable are the fields where you can configure your first advertising packet. The advertising packet in this example already contains your full device name. It also contains flags defining some of the advertising options. The flag field is mandatory, but we will discuss it here.<p></p>
<p>Search for the definition of the <code>ble_advdata_t</code> advertising data structure in your project files (right click on <code>ble_advdata_t</code> and click "Go To Definition Of 'ble_advdata_t'. This works on all functions and variables). When you find it you can see that it is a list of options and data structures with some very brief descriptions. There are quite a few options, but it is important to know that an advertising packet <strong>can consist of no more than 31 bytes</strong>, so you might need to select your data with care. <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/37952/setting-tx_power_level/">Here</a> is a useful discussion on advertising bytes. </p>
<p>First let us play with the name and pretend that we need a really long one. Find the "DEVICE_NAME" define again and change the string to “ThisIsAReallyLongName”. Compile and download the code and make sure your new name shows in the device list. This name consumes a lot of our precious 31 byte long advertising packet. So let us say we want to keep our long name, but only advertise the first few letters of it. The <code>advertising_init()</code> function should now look something like this:</p>

<p>Compile and download again. In the “Discovered devices” list your device should now show up with the name “ThisIs”, the first 6 letters of the full name. However, if you connect to your device by clicking “Select device”, “Connect” and then “Discover services” you will see that the full name is still there. In our case, this frees up 15 bytes in the advertising packet.</p>
<p></p><h3>Manufacturer Specific Data</h3>
One of the most interesting fields in the advertising data structure might be the <code>p_manuf_specific_data</code> field. This is a field where you can place whatever data you want. So copy the <code>advertising_init()</code> function below:<p></p>

<p>Now compile, download and check your MCP. You can see that there is a new field in the “Advertising Data” list called “ManufacturerSpecificData”. It contains a cryptic string of hexadecimal numbers. The first two numbers are the company ID (0x0059) with the least significant byte first. The company ID is a unique 16-bit value assigned to Bluetooth SIG members. It is not allowed to broadcast a custom company ID value without being a member. If you are curious you can see a list of the Bluetooth SIG member IDs <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/assigned-numbers/company-identifiers">here</a>. As described at the bottom of the page the value 0xFFFF "<em>may be used in the internal and interoperability tests before a Company ID has been assigned. This value shall not be used in shipping end products</em>". When you are ready for shipping you will need to apply for a Bluetooth SIG membership to get your own unique ID. "Adopter level" membership is free, but you will need to be associated with a valid company.
The next 10 bytes in the manufacturer specific data field are the actual data. If you compare with an ASCII table you will recognize the string “SomeData!”, most significant byte first this time. The last two zeroes at the end represent a termination character in the string. </p>
<p><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Try to add and populate the <i>"p_tx_power_level"</i> field in <i>"advdata"</i> with a value of your own choice and see what happens in MCP. This field is meant to advertise the transmit power of your device. This value might, e.g., enable other units to roughly estimate the distance to your device. (Keep in mind that you will have to use one of the valid tx power levels shown in Chapter 8.5.3 in the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/Products/nRF51822/nRF51822-PS/20339">nRF51 Product Specification V3.1</a>. It is also important to know that this doesn't change the actual transmit power, just the information that is advertised).</p>
<p><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Set the <i>"include_appearance"</i> field in <i>"advdata"</i> to <i>"true"</i> and see what happens in MCP. Then search for <code>sd_ble_gap_appearance_set(0)</code> in your main file and change the ‘0’ to <i>“BLE_APPEARANCE_HID_MOUSE”</i> and see what happens. The appearance feature might be useful to developers of e.g. mobile phone apps. If you have a BLE enabled phone (or a laptop) your kit should now show up with the name "ThisIs" and a computer mouse icon if you search for BLE devices.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Your advertisement packet is already getting dangerously full so you might want to shorten your manufacturer data size or device name.</p>
<p>This is what I can see on my phone:</p>
<p><img src="./BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial_files/5982a6f38b8af1b55629a1ebfc37a5aa" width="300"></p>
<p></p><h2>Scan response data</h2>
But what if you really, really want to advertise more than 31 bytes? Then there is a solution for you and that is the Scan response data. This is an optional "secondary" advertising payload which allows scanning devices that detect an advertising device to request a second advertising packet. This allows you to send two advertising frames with a total payload of 62 bytes. <p></p>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> 
In your code, immediately above the line <code>err_code = ble_advdata_set(&amp;advdata, NULL)</code>, do the following:</p>
<ul><ol>
<li>Declare a new <i>"ble_advdata_manuf_data_t"</i> type variable called <i>"manuf_data_response"</i>.</li>
<li>Populate <i>"manuf_data_response"</i> with data as we did with the first advertising packet.</li>
<li>Declare a new <i>"ble_advdata_t"</i> type variable called <i>"advdata_response"</i>.</li>
<li>Populate <i>"advdata_response"</i> with name type <i>"BLE_ADVDATA_NO_NAME"</i>.</li>
<li>Populate <i>"advdata_response"</i> with your new manufacturer specific data. </li>
<li>Change the line
<p><code>err_code = ble_advdata_set(&amp;advdata, NULL);</code></p>
<p>to</p> <code>err_code = ble_advdata_set(&amp;advdata, &amp;advdata_response);</code></li>
<li>Compile, download and see what happens. </li>
</ol></ul><p>This should make your device look something like this in MCP:
<img src="./BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial_files/ad57e564f2585fd349e4d84cb4979d7e" alt="Advertising with Scan response"></p>
<p>In case you need help your <code>advertising_init()</code> function should now look similar to this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">nRF51_SDK_8</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="lit">0.0</span><span class="pln">_5fc2c3a</span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">examples</span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">ble_peripheral</span></code></pre>
<p>of the official SDK, then downloading the code example by typing</p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">git clone https</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="com">//github.com/NordicSemiconductor/nrf51-ble-tutorial-advertising.git</span></code></pre>
<p>after that you can proceed compiling as you always did with other example projects :)</p>
<p>I hope it helped,</p>
<p>Francesco</p>

    <p>Hi. Thank you for your comment. I have updated the text to make it clearer for future readers. As stated in your link:</p>
<blockquote><p>This value [0xFFFF] may be used in the internal and interoperability tests before a Company ID has been assigned. This value shall not be used in shipping end products.</p>

</blockquote><p>Any other values are reserved and forbidden to use in an end product. When you are ready for shipping you will need to apply for a Bluetooth SIG membership to get your own unique ID. "Adopter level" membership is free, but you will need to be associated with a valid company. </p>

<p>This is how I configured the memory address. </p>

    <p>@John: I can see that you have used the Pack installer. The third sentence in your quote actually states that the example will <em>not</em> work with pack installer. Download the SDK 8.0.0 .zip-file from <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF51_SDK/nRF51_SDK_v8.x.x/">here</a>, ectract it to a folder of your own chosing and then extract the example as instructed. I know the Pack vs .zip-file is confusing and we have a lot of people struggling with the same issue. In general we recommend the .zip-file solution as this will get rid of the "file not found" errors you have. </p>

    <p>@ Shubham Kumar Mishra : The PCA10003 has an old revision 2 nRF51422 on it. As you can see in the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/nordic/download_resource/41917/6/78189326">Compatibility Matrix</a> this is not compatible with SDK V8.0.0 and SoftDevice S110 V8.0.0. Hence, it is not guaranteed to work with this example either. However, I did try the tutorial on my PCA10003 and it seems to work, but I haven't tested it thoroughly. Also, as a sidenote, the PCA10003 only has 16kB of RAM and you should set your IRAM1 size to 0x2000 instead of 0x6000. If this is a problem with your function <code>TICK_LED()</code> we can't help you unless you post your code. </p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> if your problem is related to your <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/37789/ble-is-not-working-on-pca10003-ek-nrf51422-based-device/">question here</a> then lets continue our problem solving there. </p>

    <p>Can I use this example with SDK 8.1.0 ?</p>
<p>I tried and I got a build error.</p>
<p>Step to reproduce and find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone github files in the right place under SDK 8.1.0</li>
<li>Open the project and build</li>
<li>In nRF_Libraries -&gt; app_button.c I see (line 19) #include "nrf_drv_gpiote.h"</li>
</ul>
<p>The error is that nrf_drv_gpiote.h isn't found.</p>
<p>I tried to import the example in the SDK 8.0.0 and all works fine; so I tried to open the app_button.c of the SDK 8.0.0 and it's different from app_button.c of the SDK 8.1.0.</p>
<p>If app_button.c is part of the nRF_Libraries of SDK 8.1.0, and If it includes nrf_drv_gpiote.h that's part of the library too. Could be a bug or I'm doing something wrong?
Thanks</p>

    <p>I'm afraid that you can't use it with SDK 8.1.0. If you look at the <code>advertising_init()</code> function in main.c in SDK V8.1.0 you can see that is has some differences from V8.0.0 as well. But the example code used in the tutorial is very similar to the ble_app_template examples so with a little extra effort you can use this. You just need to take a close look at advertising_init() and ble_advertising_init() (called in advertising_init() and located in ble_advertising.c) and you should be able to recognize a lot of stuff. 
<img src="./BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial_files/7a8cfe1fc9d0b36d08331a9bafceecd9" alt="image description"></p>
<p>I say that it might be easy, but to make the tutorial compatible with SDK 8.1.0 I'll need to rewrite a lot of text and make new example code so I probably won't prioritize that. </p>

    <p>Becons have a specific configuration of the adveritisng packet. The Beacon app is scanning for and shows only devices with this configuration. Take a look at the <a href="https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF51_SDK/nRF51_SDK_v8.x.x/doc/8.0.0/s110/html/a00061.html">ble_app_beacon example</a> in the SDK. </p>

    When I change the code as instructed in the tutorial </p>
<p><img src="./BLE Advertising, a beginner's tutorial_files/51a72769626d0f161725e8453427e049" alt="image description"> </p>
<p>My dongle does not even detect the device. Meanwhile when I comment out the following code </p>
<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pln">   </span><span class="com">// err_code = ble_advdata_set(&amp;p_advdata, NULL);</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="com">//  APP_ERROR_CHECK(err_code);// Check for errors</span></code></pre>
<p>My device becomes detected yet on the advertise data of MCP nothing shows up. Why is this happening and What is the purpose of this challange ?</p>
<p>Thank You,
Milad</p>

    <p>Hi Milad. Could it be that you advertising packet is already full? Remember that you can only have 31 bytes in the packet in total. Have a look at <a href="https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/37952/setting-tx_power_level/?answer=38038#post-id-38038">this explanation</a> and see if that helps. </p>

    <p>Do you have control over how many bytes you have in your packet? Adding the tx power level value will actually add 3 more bytes, not just the value; a length byte, a type byte and the tx power level byte. Can you post your .c-file? You can't attach files in the tutorial comment sections, so maybe you can post it in the thread I linked to above or send it to me on PM.</p>
<p>The next tutorial is still a work in progress. </p>

    <p>Hi~
Thansks for this post. I tried to implement the challanges but I am unable to implement the challange regarding "scan data response" for advertising data more than 31 bytes.</p>
<p>Please share some code example for reference related to modifications in advertising_init().</p>
<p>Thanks.
/Ash</p>

    <p>@martinbl :Thank you for the tutorial. It is very helpful!</p>
<p>I have a question on writing the ADC value to the manufacturer specific data. It looks like this data is only written to the packet during the advertising initialisation. </p>
<p>How do I read from the ADC (e.g. AIN2 in P0.01) and broadcast the ADC value in the advertising packet?</p>
<p>I have tried out the adc_simple example code as it was (without S100). Can I use the same ADC code in this tutorial code?</p>

    <p>Sorry for the late response guys. Holidays and busy days in general...</p>
<p>@HSA: Did you try to copy paste the code at the bottom of the tutorial to get scan response working? Are you getting any errors returned from ble_advdata_set()?</p>
<p>@Johnson: Yes, you should be able to use the adc example code alongside the tutorial. To put adc values in your advertising packet you will have to update the manufacturer data and run advdata_set() once more to actually change det packet. </p>
<p>@harsha: Not directly I'm afraid, but with some work you should be able to port it. </p>
<p><strong>I will encourage you all to ask your questions on the forum's main page and not here in the tutorial comment field. That way it will be easier for all users and Nordic employees to see and search for your post. You will probably also get an answer faster that way.</strong> Tips and comments about the tutorial are welcome here. You can also send me a PM. </p>

    <p>Remove the star (*). You should not declare a pointer. And remember to assign a value to tx_power_level.
Try this:</p>

    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So, a regular advertisement is done continuously while the the scan response is only sent when there is a request from a central.</p>
<p>Then, is it more power efficient to put the data in the scan response or in the regular advertisement?
Are there any other criteria we have to consider when deciding which attribute to place where?
Thanks</p>
